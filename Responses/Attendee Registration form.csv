I began my coding journey with languages like C# and ASP.NET, quickly developing expertise in web development. Over the years, I've specialized in creating robust web applications, particularly focusing on property listing management and data handling features. This technical proficiency has been a cornerstone of my career.

Parallel to my coding journey, I embraced entrepreneurship with a passion for solving real-world problems through technology. Co-founding a startup in the real estate tech sector, I combined my coding skills with business acumen to create innovative solutions that address market needs. This venture taught me invaluable lessons in project management, team leadership, and client relations.

Balancing these two fields has taught me resilience, adaptability, and strategic thinking. As a coder, I stay updated with industry trends and continuously evolve my skills. As an entrepreneur, I focus on leveraging technology to drive business success. This dual experience has equipped me with a unique perspective and a versatile skill set, enabling me to tackle challenges effectively and consistently innovate.","Web2 Applications","HealthCare App, Ecommerce App","In a previous project, I faced a significant technical challenge involving the handling and parsing of property address strings in an ASP.NET web application. The goal was to extract and process address information consistently from a GridView control. However, the addresses were inconsistently formatted, leading to parsing errors and data processing issues.

The primary issue was that the addresses varied in structure, making it difficult to accurately extract specific components like street name, city, and postal code. This inconsistency disrupted the application's functionality, affecting data integrity and user experience.

To overcome this challenge, I took a systematic approach:

Understanding the Problem: I first analyzed the different address formats and identified common patterns and anomalies. This step involved examining a significant sample of address strings to understand the variations.

Developing a Parsing Strategy: Based on the analysis, I developed a robust parsing strategy. I used regular expressions (regex) to create a flexible yet precise method to extract address components. Regex allowed me to handle different address formats by defining patterns for common elements like street names, city names, and postal codes.

Implementing the Solution: I implemented the parsing logic in the RowCommand event handler of the GridView. This involved writing C# code to apply the regex patterns and extract the required address components. I also added error handling to manage any unexpected formats gracefully.

Testing and Refinement: I rigorously tested the new parsing logic with various address strings to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Based on the test results, I made refinements to handle edge cases and improve overall performance.

Enhancing User Feedback: To improve user experience, I added validation and feedback mechanisms. If an address could not be parsed correctly, the user received a clear message indicating the issue, along with suggestions for correction.

By leveraging regex for flexible parsing, implementing thorough testing, and enhancing user feedback, I successfully resolved the address parsing issue. This solution not only improved data integrity and application functionality but also enhanced the overall user experience.","Build AI base ecommerce website.","To gain Hackathon experience and explore the diversity of coding.","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1JR42rXteG1p26bsueZNdqLdMavOzpjO1","Yes","","","Word of mouth","C#, C++,JS"

During a recent day, I was working on developing an e-commerce app as part of a team. One of the key features we wanted to implement was real-time inventory tracking, which required seamless communication between the frontend and backend to update stock levels as orders were placed.

The challenge arose when we noticed a significant delay in syncing the data between the frontend and backend, leading to inaccuracies in the displayed inventory. This was a critical issue because it could result in customers ordering out-of-stock items, negatively impacting the user experience.

To tackle this problem, I first analyzed our data flow and identified that the issue was due to inefficient API calls and a lack of proper caching mechanisms. I decided to optimize our backend by implementing WebSockets for real-time updates, which allowed us to push inventory changes directly to the frontend without relying on frequent API requests. Additionally, I introduced server-side caching to reduce the load on our database.

After implementing these changes, the inventory tracking became instantaneous, and the overall performance of the app improved significantly. This experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also reinforced the importance of efficient data handling in real-time applications.","An app of Innovative Idea: Personalized Health and Wellness Platform

Each of these projects has given me the opportunity to tackle different challenges and expand my skill set. In particular, the admin panels for both the food delivery and e-commerce applications were particularly challenging. These panels required complex user management, real-time data updates, and secure handling of sensitive information. Ensuring a smooth user experience while managing the intricate backend logic, such as inventory tracking, order processing, and user role assignments, was demanding. Additionally, implementing responsive design and efficient state management to keep the admin panels intuitive and accessible across devices added to the complexity. These challenges not only tested my technical abilities but also deepened my understanding of building robust, scalable applications.","In one of my previous projects, an e-commerce website, I encountered significant challenges related to managing props and lifting state up across various components. As the application grew more complex, passing props down through multiple layers became cumbersome and error-prone. This made it difficult to maintain and update the state efficiently, especially when multiple components needed to access and modify the same data.

To overcome this, I refactored the application to use the Context API in React. By creating a global state that could be accessed by any component, I was able to simplify the data flow, reduce the need for prop drilling, and ensure that state changes were reflected consistently across the application. This not only made the codebase cleaner and more maintainable but also improved the performance and responsiveness of the application.

In the food delivery app, I faced challenges in developing the admin panel, where managing and updating the food items, orders, and user data in real time was quite complex. The primary issue was handling the dynamic updates of the food menu and orders without causing conflicts or performance bottlenecks. I solved this by implementing efficient data-fetching strategies with React Query, ensuring that the admin panel displayed the most up-to-date information while minimizing unnecessary re-renders and API calls. Additionally, I incorporated optimistic updates to provide instant feedback to the admin users","I am working on building a social media platform and an clone of zoom app ","I want to participate in Cipher Craft because it offers an exciting opportunity to challenge myself in both web development and game development, which are my primary areas of interest.

Additionally, I’ve explored areas like machine learning and artificial intelligence, which has deepened my appreciation for the transformative potential of technology.

In entrepreneurship, my focus has been on leveraging technology to create value-driven solutions. I’ve been involved in projects where I had to think critically about market needs, customer behavior, and the competitive landscape. My approach to entrepreneurship is informed by principles of lean startup methodology, which emphasizes rapid prototyping, customer feedback, and iteration. I’ve learned the importance of resilience, adaptability, and strategic planning in running a business. This combination of coding skills and entrepreneurial mindset has enabled me to innovate and solve problems creatively, whether it’s through developing a new software product or finding ways to optimize business operations. My goal is to continue merging these two disciplines to drive innovation and create meaningful impact.","Artificial Intelligence Applications;Web2 Applications","My experience with projects includes developing various management systems and clones. Here’s an overview:Quiz Management System:I developed a quiz management system designed to streamline the process of creating, administering, and grading quizzes. This system allows administrators to create quizzes with different question types, set time limits, and automatically grade answers. Users can participate in quizzes and receive instant feedback on their performance.Hotel Management System:This project involved creating a comprehensive hotel management system that handles reservations, check-ins/check-outs, room allocation, and billing. The system was designed to improve the efficiency of hotel operations, ensuring seamless management of guest services and backend processes.Library Management System:I developed a library management system to facilitate the tracking of books, borrower information, and due dates.

This practice was instrumental in enhancing my coding skills and understanding of different technologies and frameworks.","One of the most challenging technical issues I faced was during the development of a web application that required real-time data processing and visualization. The project involved creating a dashboard that displayed live updates from multiple data sources. The challenge arose when the application started experiencing significant performance issues as the volume of data increased. The dashboard became slow to load, and the real-time updates were delayed, which undermined the core functionality of the application.

The root of the problem was in how the application handled data processing. Initially, I had set up the data to be processed on the client side, which worked fine with smaller data sets but couldn't scale as the data volume grew. This approach was causing heavy browser load, leading to the sluggish performance.

To overcome this, I restructured the application by offloading the data processing to the server side. I implemented a more efficient data handling mechanism using a message queue system (such as RabbitMQ) to manage the real-time data flow. The server processed the data, and only the necessary updates were sent to the client in a compressed format. This significantly reduced the amount of data the client had to handle and improved the performance.

Additionally, I optimized the front-end by implementing lazy loading for components that were not immediately visible and utilized WebSockets for efficient real-time communication. These changes resulted in a much smoother and faster user experience, even with large data volumes. The project taught me the importance of scalable architecture and the need to anticipate potential performance bottlenecks early in the development process.","One innovative idea I have for a web development project is to create a ""Personalized Learning Hub"" platform that leverages AI to offer tailored educational content based on individual learning styles and goals. The idea is to move beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all approach to online learning by creating a platform that adapts to each user’s unique needs.

The core of this platform would be an intelligent algorithm that profiles users based on their interactions, learning preferences, and performance. For instance, if a user prefers visual learning, the platform would prioritize video content and infographics. If another user excels with hands-on practice, the system would emphasize interactive coding exercises or simulations. 

The platform could integrate with existing educational resources, drawing from a vast pool of content across various subjects. The AI would recommend the most relevant materials, creating a customized learning path for each user. As users progress, the platform would adjust the difficulty level and type of content to keep them engaged and challenged. 

Another innovative feature would be a social learning component, where users can form study groups based on shared interests or goals. AI-driven insights could suggest study partners or mentors who complement each other’s strengths and weaknesses, fostering a collaborative learning environment.

The platform could also track progress over time, providing detailed analytics and insights into a user’s learning journey. This data could be used to refine the AI’s recommendations and help users better understand their learning patterns, ultimately making education more effective and personalized.

This Personalized Learning Hub could revolutionize how people approach online learning by making it more adaptive, engaging, and tailored to individual needs.","I want to participate in Cipher Craft because it aligns perfectly with my passion for AI, Web2, and generative AI, areas that are driving the next wave of technological innovation.

The form was complex, with fields that needed to dynamically change based on user inputs. Initially, I used vanilla JavaScript for the DOM manipulation, but as the form’s complexity grew, the code became increasingly difficult to manage. The performance started to degrade, and bugs began appearing, particularly when users interacted with the dynamically generated elements.

To overcome this challenge, I decided to refactor the codebase. I introduced jQuery to handle DOM manipulations more efficiently, which simplified the code and made it more readable. Additionally, I implemented event delegation to manage events on dynamically created elements, which resolved many of the bugs related to event handling. 

Moreover, I improved the error handling mechanism by incorporating try-catch blocks and adding validation checks at each stage of user input. This approach ensured that the form would only process valid data, reducing the number of runtime errors. 

As a result, the form became more responsive, user interactions were smoother, and the overall reliability of the application improved. This experience reinforced the importance of maintainable code and choosing the right tools for complex tasks.","In the realm of web development, particularly within the e-commerce space, I have an innovative idea for a project focused on enhancing customer engagement and conversion rates on Shopify stores.

I take a different approach to learning to code than most people. While most people prefer tutorials, I prefer to make projects to learn. As such my best friend during this whole journey has been documentation and stack overflow answers.
My approach to finding these projects is quite different than most as well. Many people make passion projects and build up a portfolio, however I am quite different. Ever since I started coding I have been inclined towards working. I have worked on freelance projects, done remote work and in person internships as well as made software for family members to help with their businesses.

I do not have much experience with entrepreneurship. I have had some ideas of products or solutions I could offer, but there is none that I have put to market currently or in the past.","Web2 Applications","As mentioned above, I have done a lot of projects. These mainly include Decentralized Applications and Web2 Applications. But given my approach of working for clients I do not have many projects to show especially the code. And the fact that I am mainly a backend developers makes it even harder to show my already deployed projects.

As I have mentioned before I have worked on Shopify API Integration and Ebay API Integration. These were mainly integrated with in game bots to facilitate automated delivery of items. Of course these bots were also made by me. Initially I made the bots using websockets to communicate with a central server in real time, however later on the game updated breaking websockets connections. At that time I had to refactor my whole codebase to use HTTP Requests instead.
Refactoring the codebase would have been time consuming which was something my client could not afford as his whole business operations were down to this problem. At that time I had the idea of making a middleman that would communicate with the server using websockets but with the game using HTTP Requests, effectively converting Websockets to Long Polling and Long Polling to Websockets. I quickly deployed this solution while I started working on refactoring the codebase as this solution worked at the time but was not really efficient to keep for a long time.","I have had quite a few ideas. One of which I am currently working on so I'll describe a past idea of mine. This idea was primarily an IoT product. I had the idea of making a smart lock with some extra functionality which allowed the owner customizability. We would have connected it to a backend API and allowed people to open the lock with an RFID card or a mobile app. In both scenarios the backend would have a log of who opened the door and when which could be used with our API for companies to setup custom solutions such as employee attendance, timed access, and automated item transfer.

Unfortunately, being a university student I did not find enough time to work on such an ambitious idea.","As mentioned above I have had almost 7 years of programming experience. However, whether it be for my introverted nature or the fact that I come from Multan where such opportunities are almost nonexistent; I have never participated in hackathons or competitions where I would have had the opportunity to test my skills in real time against other people.

It was my initial foray into writing code, and though the learning curve was steep, it laid the foundation for my interest in software development. When I joined FAST for my undergraduate studies, I transitioned to C++. I quickly grew proficient in it, as the rigorous academic environment and challenging coursework encouraged me to sharpen my skills. C++ opened my eyes to the world of object-oriented programming and problem-solving at a deeper level.

In addition to C++, I also picked up the basics of web development through HTML and CSS, understanding how to create simple, static web pages. This knowledge was invaluable as I ventured into more complex development environments.

The summer after my second semester was pivotal for me. I secured an internship where I was exposed to Python, XML, and the Odoo framework. Learning Python felt natural due to its simplicity and versatility, and I was able to apply these skills in Odoo development, working with ERP solutions. The internship gave me hands-on experience in developing business applications and introduced me to the intersection of coding and entrepreneurship, where tech-driven solutions solve real-world problems. This sparked my interest in the entrepreneurial side of tech, setting me on a path to explore innovative solutions further.","Generative AI","I have developed several integrable modules for the Odoo framework, including a GPT-4 powered chatterbot that enables intelligent, conversational AI interactions within Odoo to enhance user support and automation. Additionally, I created a PDF reading module that allows users to extract and process text from PDFs directly within Odoo, streamlining document handling and improving workflows. Furthermore, I built an auto-reply bot for WhatsApp, automating responses based on specific keywords or conditions, which is particularly useful for businesses aiming to optimize customer interactions and communication efficiency.","In one of my previous projects, I faced a technical challenge while integrating the GPT-4-powered chatterbot into the Odoo framework. The primary issue was related to managing real-time communication between the Odoo server and the AI model, particularly when handling multiple concurrent requests without causing a significant delay or performance bottleneck. Odoo’s framework, being primarily web-based, required efficient handling of asynchronous requests, but the GPT-4 API's response times occasionally introduced latency.

To overcome this, I implemented an asynchronous queue system using Odoo’s `async` features combined with Redis for task management. This allowed the requests to be queued and processed in the background without blocking the main application. By using Redis, I could monitor and prioritize tasks effectively, ensuring that the most critical interactions were handled with higher priority. Additionally, I optimized the GPT-4 model's request payload by sending only essential data, reducing the size of the API calls and further minimizing response times.

Through this approach, I was able to successfully integrate the AI model without impacting Odoo’s performance, ensuring smooth, real-time interactions for users. This experience taught me the importance of efficient resource management when working with external APIs in high-traffic applications.","An innovative project idea in the realm of generative AI is to create a **""Creative Content Studio""** that uses multimodal generative AI models to produce fully customizable media content—including text, images, music, and video—tailored for businesses and individuals. This platform would allow users to generate original marketing materials, blog articles, social media posts, promotional videos, and even soundtracks, all with minimal input and guided by AI.

The idea centers around combining various AI models—like GPT-4 for text generation, DALL·E for images, and other deep learning models for audio and video production. Users could input simple prompts or select from predefined templates (e.g., a product launch video or a blog post about a specific industry). The AI would then generate the desired content, which users could further refine through a user-friendly interface.

Key innovations include:
1. **Content Consistency**: The AI would ensure that all media elements (text, images, videos) align with the brand’s tone and style. For instance, the colors in a generated image could match the color palette of the company's logo.
   
2. **Real-Time Feedback**: By integrating user feedback, the model could improve the quality of the generated content through iterative learning.

3. **Cross-Platform Publishing**: The generated content could be optimized for different platforms (Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube) and automatically formatted according to each platform’s specifications.

This project would streamline creative processes for businesses, marketers, and content creators, reducing time and costs associated with manual content creation while maintaining quality and creativity.","I want to participate in Cipher Craft because it presents a unique opportunity to challenge myself and grow both technically and creatively in the field of cybersecurity and blockchain.

The system needed to handle a high volume of transactions, integrate with various hardware devices (like barcode scanners and receipt printers), and provide real-time inventory updates. One of the significant technical challenges I faced was ensuring the seamless integration of these hardware components with the software while maintaining system performance and accuracy.

The primary issue arose from the barcode scanner integration, where the scanner's input was not consistently recognized by the system due to varying data formats and communication protocols used by different scanner models.
To overcome this challenge, I took a systematic approach:
Research and Analysis: I started by researching the different types of barcode scanners and their communication protocols. I identified the common standards and variations in data formats that needed to be handled by the system.

Modular Code Design: I implemented a modular approach in the code, where the barcode scanning functionality was abstracted into a separate module. This allowed me to write specific handling routines for different scanner models, ensuring that the input was consistently interpreted and processed by the system.

Error Handling and Logging: I added robust error handling and logging mechanisms to capture any discrepancies or failures in real-time. This helped in quickly identifying and rectifying issues as they occurred, improving the system's reliability.

Testing with Multiple Devices: I conducted extensive testing using different barcode scanners to ensure that the system could handle input from various models without any issues. This iterative testing and refinement process helped in fine-tuning the integration.","I will built something on the retail idustry that can automate the customer support operations ","I want to participate in Cipher Craft because it offers an incredible platform to challenge myself, innovate, and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

As an AI enthusiast and a mobile app developer, I’ve consistently pushed the boundaries of innovation, particularly in healthcare applications. At Xavor Corporation, I was an AI intern where I played a pivotal role in developing a Glioma Segmentation Model, leveraging advanced AI techniques to enhance diagnostic accuracy. My efforts were recognized by my peers and senior mentors, who acknowledged my dedication and innovative approach.

","Artificial Intelligence Applications;Generative AI","I’ve successfully completed a project to develop a cutting-edge MRI analysis chatbot. This tool uses AI to interpret MRI images, aiding healthcare professionals by providing structured insights and filling out critical forms automatically. My deep understanding of AI was further strengthened by attending a Generative AI bootcamp, where I delved into RAG, LangChain, and LlamaIndex.. ","In my previous project, where I developed an innovative MRI analysis chatbot, I encountered a significant technical challenge: the unstructured nature of the chatbot’s responses. Initially, the AI was able to analyze MRI images and provide insights, but the output lacked organization, making it difficult for healthcare professionals to quickly interpret the findings.

The problem was rooted in the AI’s response generation process. The information was correct but presented in a continuous block of text, which wasn’t conducive to effective communication in a medical context. This issue required not only technical adjustments but also a rethinking of how the AI processed and structured its outputs.

To overcome this, I revised the entire response generation pipeline. I introduced a mechanism to organize the chatbot’s output into well-structured sections with clear headings and paragraphs. This required integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to segment the information logically and coherently. I also implemented a summarization feature that condensed key points into bullet points for quick review, improving the overall user experience.","One innovative idea I have is to develop an Autonomous Health Assistant for Windows and Mac. This system would integrate AI and automation to streamline routine healthcare tasks for medical professionals, making their workflows more efficient and accurate.

The core of the project would involve creating an application that can automate administrative tasks like updating patient records, scheduling appointments, and even performing preliminary diagnostic assessments based on patient data. Leveraging AI, the assistant would analyze Electronic Health Records (EHR) to identify patterns, flagging potential issues such as medication conflicts or missed follow-ups.

What sets this project apart is its ability to directly interact with the healthcare provider’s system, making real-time updates and recommendations. For instance, when a new lab result is uploaded, the assistant could cross-reference it with the patient’s history and suggest possible diagnoses or further tests. It could also automatically prepare pre-authorization forms for insurance, based on the data gathered from EHR, ensuring that nothing is missed and reducing the administrative burden on healthcare professionals.

By integrating these capabilities into a single autonomous system, this project could revolutionize the way healthcare providers manage their day-to-day tasks, allowing them to focus more on patient care and less on paperwork.","I want to participate in Cipher Craft because it represents an incredible opportunity to push the boundaries of my technical and creative abilities in a highly competitive and collaborative environment. Hackathons like Cipher Craft are where innovation thrives, and I’m eager to contribute my skills in AI, mobile development, and automation to solve real-world problems.

The unique challenges posed by Cipher Craft align perfectly with my passion for developing solutions that have a tangible impact, particularly in the healthcare domain. I’m excited about the chance to work alongside like-minded individuals who are equally driven by a desire to innovate. The fast-paced nature of a hackathon excites me, as it forces quick thinking, rapid prototyping, and effective teamwork—skills that I continuously strive to improve.

Moreover, Cipher Craft offers an invaluable platform to learn from others, share knowledge, and gain exposure to new ideas and technologies that can shape my future projects.","https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=18urChOJyveak6OJL0wsUuvmsJiyf26Io","Yes","Khurram Iqbal","Yes","",""

I’ve worked on real-world projects, doing stuff like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and fine-tuning models for better accuracy. ","Artificial Intelligence Applications;Generative AI","I worked on an end-to-end project to predict wine quality, which was also my first real dive into MLOps. The idea was to use the chemical properties of wine, like acidity and alcohol content, to predict its quality. I tried out different models, like Random Forest and XGBoost, and deployed the best one. I also set up a CI/CD pipeline, used Docker to make everything portable, and deployed the model on AWS so it could be accessed via an API. This project was a hands-on experience in seeing an AI project through from start to finish. While I don’t have a public link, But here is Repo link from my Github:

https://github.com/MahraibFatima/rudder","One challenge I faced while predicting wine quality is that the ratings are imbalanced some Very much frequent and rare than others. This imbalance in the data led to personalized predictions: our model's predictions were more likely on the amount of wine than any other rating. To solve this problem, I used SMOTE to create synthetic samples for the minority classes and assigned class weights so that less frequent classes had greater significance in classification. Also, I evaluated the model with measures such as F1 score and confusion matrix, to gain an understanding of performance. These steps were effective in equalizing the model’s predictions and making it perform well on all quality ratings.","I have an idea for a modular robot that can be powered by AI named RoboCare which will take care of daily jobs and act as a companion to the elderly. Each user would have their own robot that became a unique experience, helping with everything from walking to health monitoring and providing companionship to fight loneliness. Shining a light on its modularity, components can easily be added or removed as the user's needs change. RoboCare smart AI would keep track of routines and preferences all while offering personalized care, and reminders. The project should help the elderly live independently and provide older persons with better quality of life, allowing them to stay in their homes for longer periods while alleviating pressure on healthcare services.","The Cipher Craft is a wonderful chance for me to extend my talents and raise my creativity up one level.

I focused on Web3 development during my internship at Vanar, where I worked on creating decentralized apps (dApps) and learned to write smart contracts using Solidity. I developed blockchain-based web apps, where I gained experience with MetaMask for user authentication and handling blockchain transactions. I also worked on front-end development using React.js to ensure smooth interaction between the blockchain and users.

In entrepreneurship, I have been involved in businesses that focus on customized products. I co-founded Paperie, a business that offers personalized stationery. This involved understanding what customers wanted and providing unique products. Another business I worked on is Jaxor, a clothing line that offers custom-made tracksuits, allowing customers to design their own outfits.

I also ventured into digital business by selling custom design templates online. This allowed me to use my design skills to serve an online market. Through these experiences, I learned important lessons in branding, marketing, and keeping customers happy, which have shaped my approach to business.","Decentralized Applications","https://github.com/Vanar-Builders/CarbonChain","One technical challenge I faced in a previous project was distributing ERC-20 tokens efficiently to multiple users. The goal was to automate the process of sending tokens to many recipients, but doing it manually or in batches posed risks such as high gas fees and transaction failures.

To overcome this, I implemented a solution using Merkle trees for token distribution. Instead of sending tokens individually, I stored a Merkle root on-chain that represented the list of all recipients and their corresponding token amounts. Each recipient could then claim their tokens by providing a Merkle proof, which significantly reduced the number of on-chain transactions.

This approach saved gas fees by shifting the computational effort off-chain. Recipients could verify their inclusion in the list without the need for the contract owner to send tokens one by one. I used OpenZeppelin libraries to ensure security and reliability in creating and verifying the Merkle tree.

By structuring the distribution this way, the token distribution process became more scalable and cost-effective, especially for large batches of users. This experience taught me the importance of optimizing blockchain transactions for both cost and performance.","NFT or Tokens for Tickets ","I want to participate in Cipher Craft because it offers a unique opportunity to challenge myself in a competitive environment focused on blockchain technology, a field I am deeply passionate about.

As a 5th-semester IT student and a passionate full-stack developer, I have gained significant experience in both coding and entrepreneurship. My expertise lies in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), which I have utilized to develop various full-fledged web applications. I have worked on projects like e-commerce platforms, data analysis dashboards, and interactive applications. Additionally, I am familiar with MS SQL Server, which has helped me manage structured data effectively and implement complex queries for data-driven applications.

My coding journey has been shaped by hands-on projects that allowed me to build both frontend and backend systems. I have developed RESTful APIs, integrated third-party APIs like Firebase and Twilio, and implemented robust authentication and security features in my applications. These projects have given me a deep understanding of application architecture, database design, and performance optimization.

In addition to coding, I have been actively exploring entrepreneurship. Recently, I have been collaborating with colleagues to launch an IT solutions web agency. This entrepreneurial endeavor has given me insight into business operations, client management, and market research, further enhancing my skills beyond coding.","Web2 Applications","1.

XSpeech: https://xspeech.netlify.app","In my HealthPulse project, a full-stack healthcare data analysis platform, I encountered a significant challenge when integrating complex data queries with the frontend. The project used React for the frontend, Tailwind CSS and Ant Design for UI, and Node.js with Express.js as the backend. The backend relied on MS SQL Server to manage and query large datasets for health metrics.

The main challenge was optimizing the performance of SQL queries, especially when retrieving large data sets that would slow down the application. The inefficient querying caused delays in displaying data visualizations on the frontend.

To overcome this, I focused on optimizing the database queries by indexing the most queried columns and rewriting complex joins. I also implemented pagination on the frontend, which allowed data to load in chunks rather than all at once, improving load times. Caching frequently accessed data also helped reduce the load on the server.

These improvements streamlined data flow and enhanced the overall user experience, ensuring faster performance and seamless data analysis.","An innovative idea for a project is FitMentor, a platform that integrates physical and mental health tracking using AI.

Ive worked with different programming languages and developed a variety of projects, from small personal ones to more complex applications. Each project taught me something new, whether it was learning a new framework or improving my problem-solving skills. I enjoye building things from the ground up and constantly challenging myself to find better ways to solve problems.

Beyond coding, I’ve also been diving into entrepreneurship. Recently, I completed an 8-week internship where we developed startups from scratch. This experience was a turning point for me, as it gave me the chance to learn not only about software development but also about the business side of things. From brainstorming ideas, building a product that solves real-world problems, to pitching it, this was a crash course in entrepreneurship. It helped me see the bigger picture and understand how important it is to connect technology with industry needs.

Altogether, my experience has been a mix of technical learning and entrepreneurial growth, and I’m excited to keep pushing both aspects as I move forward in my career.","Artificial Intelligence Applications;Web2 Applications","Machine Learning Projects:
I worked on a natural language processing (NLP) project that involved creating a vector database, which helped me explore how to handle large sets of textual data and derive meaningful insights from them. This project deepened my understanding of NLP techniques and how to use them in practical scenarios.
I also worked on an ML projects that was a supervised learning model I implemented in a snake game. I used tensorflow to train the AI to play the game on its own, which was a fun and experience.
Web Development:
I’ve developed a full fledged MERN stack application (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), which has been my go-to stack for building Web2 applications. It was actually the product I created along with my team for my startup in the internship. You can check out my linkedin for proper detail. This project have given me solid experience in both front-end and back-end development, from designing user interfaces to managing databases and creating APIs.
Game Development:
I’ve created a few games using Unity, where I’ve learned how to build game mechanics, integrate animations, and design engaging user experiences. Game development has helped me merge my interest in both coding and creativity.
Generative AI:
Although I haven’t developed anything directly related to generative AI, I’ve experimented with platforms like Hugging Face and ComfyUI. These tools have allowed me to explore the world of generative models, particularly in generating text and images. And helped me understand the importance of prompt engineering.
All these projects can be seen on my github and linkedin","In my current Web2 project for a school, I faced a challenge with managing a large database that my laptop couldnt handle. To overcome this, I moved the database to the cloud using Vercel, which supports PostgreSQL. This allowed me to bypass the limitations of my local machine. However, since I’m on Vercel’s trial plan, I still need to manage performance and resource constraints carefully. This experience has helped me understand cloud based database management and how to adapt to limited resources while maintaining efficiency.","As someone who has experienced the challenges of working out at home while trying to lose weight, I’ve noticed a gap in existing fitness apps and platforms. Many offer workout plans and routines, but one major issue I faced was maintaining the correct posture during exercises. Incorrect posture can not only reduce the effectiveness of a workout but also increase the risk of injury.

I have an idea for a project that addresses this problem. I want to create a platform that combines personalized workout plans with diet recommendations and integrates computer vision to analyze the user’s posture in real-time. The platform would use a device’s camera to track movements and provide instant feedback to help users correct their form during exercises. This would ensure a safer and more effective workout experience.

Additionally, the platform could offer tailored workout and diet plans based on individual fitness goals.
So it will be like a whole virtual trainer.","I was intrigued by the workshops it was conducting and a challenge like hackathon will just boost my adrenaline. It’s a fun experience and a good opportunity I don’t want to miss out on.

I started with Python, which introduced me to fundamental programming concepts like variables, loops, and functions. Python’s simplicity made it easier for me to grasp these concepts, and I quickly grew comfortable with problem-solving. From there, I delved into JavaScript, which opened up the world of web development. Understanding JavaScript allowed me to work on dynamic web pages, interact with user inputs, and manipulate HTML elements. Speaking of HTML, I also have a basic understanding of it, which complements my JavaScript knowledge. This has helped me appreciate the structure of web pages and how to enhance them visually and interactively.

These languages introduced me to deeper programming concepts such as pointers, data structures, and object-oriented programming. While they were more challenging compared to Python and JavaScript, they helped me understand the importance of optimized code. Overall, having experience in multiple languages has broadened my problem-solving skills and I understand languages easily. I look forward to building on this foundation and tackling more complex projects. I want to learn the use of python in Data Science and I will achieve my goal with time","Artificial Intelligence Applications;Generative AI","I have not worked on big projects of my interests since i'm a freshie but I have a lot of interest in using languages to automate things. Yet i have made small projects on school and college level all by myself which reflects my problem solving skills.","One technical challenge I faced was improving my problem-solving approach when tackling algorithmic questions. Early on, I would jump straight into coding without fully analyzing the problem, which often led to inefficient or incorrect solutions. 
To overcome this, I focused on enhancing my problem-solving skills by learning structured approaches such as breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems, understanding time and space complexity, and writing pseudocode before coding. ","I have a long term plan of working on Data science and AstroPhysics as an interdesciplinary science and make calculations similar to what many of us may have heard,, "" In some million years, Andromeda galaxy will collide with our Milky way galaxy"" etc","I want to participate in CipherCraft because I am eager to expand my knowledge and experience the latest innovations in technology. Events like CipherCraft provide a unique opportunity to not only learn from experts but also engage with cutting-edge developments that are shaping the future of the industry. I am particularly excited about the chance to challenge myself through hands-on activities, which will allow me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios and problem-solving.
